# restaurant-page
The focus of this project was using Webpack and ES6 Modules to organize the code. One of the parameters was to use a bare bones HTML page and to, instead, generate all HTML elements using JS. This method was certainly good practice for coding DOM generation, but I found it to be cumbersome and tedious compared to simply creating all elements within the HTML file.

Regarding the organization of the code, I enjoyed the ES6 Modules and using import/export because it easily kept the code clean and compartmentalized. Webpack definitely has a learning curve. It was slightly overwhelming at the beginning having to deal with npm and the webpack.config.js file. I wonder if all the configurations and command line inputs become second nature to developers who routinely use webpack.

Overall, I am happy with the final result. The project allowed me to produce a functional modern and playful restaurant page that mimics the behavior of a website with "tabs."
